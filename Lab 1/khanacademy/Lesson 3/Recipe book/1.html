            A British apple pie is the classic dessert or tea time treat. The pie is the stalwart of baking and practically every country has their own style. This one is a traditional British, and also Irish, one. Cinnamon is an optional, and not a traditional, flavor in the U.K. Though it is found here more often now as the flavor has crept over from the U.S.<br><br>

The perfect apples for this pie are Bramleys. They have a lovely balance of sweet to acidic, and provide a nice tenderness when cooked, which makes them the best. If you do not have Bramleys, then feel free to use any good cooking apple. And, if really stuck, a good dessert apple will also work, though the apples will not be as soft when cooked.
