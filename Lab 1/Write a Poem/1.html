    <h1>Death Is Nothing At All</h1>
        <h2>By Henry Scott-Holland</h2>
        
        <p>Death is nothing at all.<br>
It does not count.<br>
I have only slipped away into the next room.<br>
Nothing has happened.<br><br>

Everything remains exactly as it was.<br>
I am I, and you are you,<br>
and the old life that we lived so fondly<br> together is untouched, unchanged.<br>
Whatever we were to each other, that we are still.<br>
        </p>
